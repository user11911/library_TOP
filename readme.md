# library

it should show a list of the books with a toggle button to change if read or not and a delete button. there should lastly be a button to add mre, whihc shows a form to add more. the form should have the ability to be closed or resetted and it should all be smooth. 
every book is made of title, author, and read or not. the button should change whether it is read or not and have some basic style
there should be some basic styling, but dont waste too much time and hopefully do it all for this night.
